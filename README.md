The official repository for code of paper "EHRAgent: Code Empowers Large Language Models for Complex Tabular Reasoning on Electronic Health Records". EHRAgent is an LLM agent empowered with a code interface, to autonomously generate and execute code for complex clinical tasks within electronic health records (EHRs).

### Features

- EHRAgent is an LLM agent augmented with tools and medical knowledge, to solve complex tabular reasoning derived from EHRs;
- Planning with a code interface, EHRAgent enables the LLM agent to formulate a clinical problem-solving process as an executable code plan of action sequences, along with a code executor;
- We introduce interactive coding between the LLM agent and code executor, iteratively refining plan generation and optimizing code execution by examining environment feedback in depth.

### Data Preparation

We use the [EHRSQL](https://github.com/glee4810/EHRSQL) benchmark for evaluation. The original dataset is for text-to-SQL task, and we have made adaptations on our evaluation. We release our clean and pre-processed version of [EHRSQL-EHRAgent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EE_g3kroKJW_2Op6T2PiZbDSrIQRMtps/view?usp=sharing) data. Please download the data and record the path of the data.

### Credentials Preparation
Our experiments are based on OpenAI API services. Please record your API keys and other credentials in the ``./ehragent/config.py``. 

### Setup

See ``requirements.txt``. Packages with versions specified in ``requirements.txt`` are used to test the code. Other versions are not fully tested by may also work. We also kindly suggest the users to run this code with Python version: ``python>=3.9``. Install required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Instructions

The outputting results will be saved under directory ``./logs/``. Use the following command to run our code:
```bash
python main.py --llm YOUR_LLM_NAME --dataset mimic_iii --data_path YOUR_DATA_PATH --logs_path YOUR_LOGS_PATH --num_questions -1 --seed 0
```

We also support debugging mode to focus on single question:
```bash
python main.py --llm YOUR_LLM_NAME --dataset mimic_iii --data_path YOUR_DATA_PATH --logs_path YOUR_LOGS_PATH --debug --debug_id QUESTION_ID_TO_DEBUG
```

For **eICU** dataset, just change the option of dataset to ``--dataset eicu``.
